# Blockfire

Blockfire is a decentralised storage platform.

Just like S3 or Snowflake you upload your file though the web interface or via the API. However unlike the traditional services the Blockfire than distributes the data across the Blockfire network nodes. Using this mechanism the data is stored in an ultra secure environment for very cheap and without any downtime. The Blockfire network also copies the files across multiple locations across its network and thus the system also works like a CDN enabling low latency connections.

The system is essantially a CDN network built on top of a blockchain enabling higher capacity for lower cost.

The Blockfire network is the world's first decentralised hosting service. The service has a central server only to store and distribute the data so the server acts only as a node balancer.
